# Hand Gesture Recognition

## Overview

A hand gesture recognition project in Python uses computer vision techniques to detect and classify specific hand poses or movements captured via a camera in real time. Python, along with libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe, is often used for the image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning components that power the recognition system.

## Core Components

The project typically starts by capturing video frames from a webcam.

Image preprocessing steps such as background subtraction, color segmentation, or blurring are applied to isolate the hand from the background.

Keypoints or landmarks (such as fingertips, knuckles, etc.) are detected using libraries like MediaPipe, which provides real-time hand tracking and 3D landmark extraction.

Hand gestures are recognized by either rule-based methods (e.g., counting raised fingers, convex hull analysis) or by training a classification model on features extracted from the hand pose (using frameworks like TensorFlow or scikit-learn).

## Typical Workflow
Import required packages: cv2 (OpenCV), numpy, mediapipe, tensorflow, etc.

Load or train a gesture recognition model using labeled hand gesture images.

Initialize video stream, detect the hand and extract landmarks, preprocess data, and classify gestures frame-by-frame.

Trigger application-specific actions based on recognized gestures.
